# Beep / Multi-stage Fitness Test App
A web app that allows people conduct a yo-yo intermittent recovery test, level 1.

# Project description
This is a Streamlit web app written in Python 3.8.10. It allows people to set up a yo-yo intermittent recovery test level 1, play the audio and enter their test score to find out what it means.<br>
The project has been built in Streamlit V1.27.0 and distributed as a public app on the Streamlit Community Cloud.<br>
There are no plans to develop or update the app (except for bug fixes). Users have the option to contact the authors to suggest changes or improvements which we might implement if we think they are a good idea and it\'s worth our while. But probably not.<br>
